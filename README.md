###### [API](https://github.com/yujiosaka/flow-modal/blob/main/docs/API.md) | [Contributing](https://github.com/yujiosaka/flow-modal/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) | [Changelog](https://github.com/yujiosaka/flow-modal/blob/main/docs/CHANGELOG.md)

**flow-modal** is a flexible UI library for orchestrating multi‚Äêstep experiences in modern web applications. Built with Web Components, flow-modal makes it easy to create guided flows with built‚Äêin state persistence, rich animations, and event-driven interactions.

## üåü Features

- **Modular Components:**
  - `<flow-modal>`: A container that manages and orchestrates a sequence of steps.
  - `<flow-step>`: Represents an individual step in the flow. Each step can include modal content and supports customizable animations.
  - `<flow-badge>`: An optional badge component that can display hints, countdowns, or actionable buttons.
- **Rich Animation Options:**  
  Support animations such as fade, fly, and zoom effects for showing/hiding modals and badges.

- **State Persistence:**  
  Automatically persist flow state (using local, cookie, or in‚Äëmemory storage) so users continue where they left off.

- **Event‚ÄëDriven Architecture:**  
  Listen to events like `flowmodalstarted`, `flowstepactivated`, or `flowbadgeclicked` to integrate custom behaviors.

- **Accessibility & Customization:**
  Designed with ARIA labels and configurable CSS variables so you can seamlessly match your app‚Äôs design.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install flow-modal
```

### Basic Usage

Include the components in your project by importing them from the published package. For example, you might add the following to your HTML:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>flow-modal Example</title>
    <!-- Import the flow-modal components -->
    <script type="module" src="path/to/flow-modal.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <flow-modal>
      <flow-step ready timeout-duration="1m" backdrop hide-button-icon="close">
        <flow-badge hint-text="Click to open modal" button-icon="bell" button-count-down-format="mm:ss"></flow-badge>
        <h2>Welcome to Our Presentation!</h2>
        <p>This is the first step of our presentation flow. You have one minute to review this announcement.</p>
      </flow-step>
      <flow-step ready backdrop>
        <flow-badge button-text="Click"></flow-badge>
        <h2>Presentation Details</h2>
        <p>Thank you for viewing the introduction. This is the second step of the presentation.</p>
      </flow-step>
    </flow-modal>
